<h1>Argentine Black and White Tegus: Invasive Species of South Florida</h1>

<h2>Introduction to the United States</h2> 
<p>Argentine black and white tegus are not native to the United States. They were to introduced into North America through the pet trade. However, many owners of tegus lack
the space and resources available to<a href="Tegu care Page.html"> care for them</a>, which results in many of them being released into the wild in Florida. With South Florida providing the ideal climate for the tegus to
thrive, they establish breeding populations in the region.

<h2>Impact on Native Wildlife</h2>   
<p>In their native homeland, tegus are experts at using their powerful forelimbs to excavate nests of other reptiles and ground-nesting birds. In the Everglades of Florida, tegus 
are putting many native species in danger of becoming threatened, possibly endangered. Tegus consume the eggs of native reptiles such as alligators and turtles. Native ground-nesting 
birds eggs are also consumed. In fact, entire nests of these animals can be destroyed by tegus. With native reptiles and birds not given a chance to be born, their populations suffer
greatly.

<h2>Management of Black and White Tegus</h2>
<p>
In the state of Florida, tegus can be trapped and humanely uthanized on site. They are hunted all year around in order to control the population. Tegus are even considered a delicacy to some.
