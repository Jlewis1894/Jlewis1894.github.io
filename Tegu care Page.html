<h1>Caring for Black and White Tegus</h1>

<h2>Size of Tegus</h2> 

<p>Argentine tegus are large roaming lizards that require adequate space to thrive in a captive environment. An adult male can grow up to 5 feet long and weigh up to 20 pounds.
Females average at about 3 feet long and weigh up to 10 pounds. Such large lizards that roam great distances in the wild will need a spacious and comfortable enclosure that suits 
their daily needs. They will also require a varied omnivorous diet to live a long healthy life. In this care guide, we will discuss what tegus eat, what size enclosures they require, and
if tegus are compatible with a person's lifestyle.    
</p>

<div id="Captive-diet">

<h2>Diet in Captivity</h2>

<p>Being omnivores, tegus in the wild will eat small birds, insects, bird and reptile eggs, small mammals, fruits, and vegetables. To support the health of a tegu in captivity,
we must replicate their natural diet to the best of our ability. Many people buy tegus as hatchlings (infants). Hatchlings possess a high metabolism which makes them voracious eaters
in their first year of life. They will need to eat on a daily basis to support their steady growth and development. As hatchlings, tegus can be fed small insects such as crickets, 
grasshoppers, dubia roaches, mealworms, and occasional hornworms.     
</p>
<p>Along with live animal protein such as the insects listed, they will need a varied mix of fruits and vegetables. Some safe and healthy fruits to feed them include papaya, mangos, bananas,
apples, and blueberries. Along with these fruits, they will need a variety of vegetables to support their health. Essential vegatables include red, yellow, and green bell peppers, and carrots which
contain vitamin C, essential for fighting bacterial growth in their mouth due to bits of food left in their teeth. Citrus fruits such as oranges and avocados should never be given to tegus since their
bodies cannot process the high levels of acid in these fruits.  
</p>
<p>
As juveniles, sub-adults, and adults, they will need to be transitioned to a diet that includes lean meat such as ground turkey and ground chicken. With adults having a lower metabolism,
they will not need to eat on a daily basis as hatchlings do. Adults can be fed 2 to 3 times a week. Occasionaly, tegus can be fed ground beef. However, ground beef is high in fat and should 
rarely be fed to tegus since they are prone to obesity.
</p>

<div id="Enclosure">
<h2>Enclosure Size</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, tegus are large lizards that require a great amount of space to live happily. Large rectangular-shaped enclosures are best when housing them. To ensure a 
    comfortable living space. An adult tegu will need an enclosure with the minimum of dimensions 0f 8 feet in length by 4 feet in width by 3 feet in height. This amount of space will 
allow the lizard to turn around comfortably without feeling cramped and enables them to roam a certain distance with ease. </p>

<div id="Enclosure Climate">
<h2>Environmental Control</h2>
<p>Coming from a tropical environment, tegus require a particular climate within their enclosure space. Tegus thrive in envoronments with moist air. The humidity of a tegu's 
enclosure should range from 60%-80%. High ranging humidity helps tegus shed their skin with ease as they grow. Also, a humid environment discourages the air in a tegu's enclosure 
from becoming filled with dust which could cause issues with the animal's breathing. </p>

<div id="Dirt">
<h2>Bedding/Substrates</h2>
<p>To achieve proper humidity, an owner needs to have proper bedding or substrate. A substrate that is best for tegus is one that can retain moisture. Substrate such as cypress 
mulch or bark. The substrate must be well-misted every so often to keep humidity levels in proper range. This type of substrate also allows tegus to burrow when needed.
